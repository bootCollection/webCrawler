Web Crawler
Elliot Etches

A _very_ basic web crawler.

Takes two URLs and prints a link between them if such a link exists. 

-Compilation-
-> "make" should build the program
-> "make test1" will execute the first test
-> "make test2" will execute the second test
-> "make test3" will execute the third test
-> Tests two and three may take a minute or two to run.

-Usage-
-> "./main <startURL> <endURL>"
